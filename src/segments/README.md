# Segments

Segments are the parts that make up the prompt. They can be added and removed in
any order. They are executed asynchronously so they cannot be dependent on other
segments.

## Creating your own segments
You can create your own segments by placing a file in:
```
   ${HOME}/.config/sbp/segments/${your_segment_name}.bash
```

This script should contain at least a function called
`segments::${your_segment_name}` and it will have the following variables
available upon execution:
```
  - COMMAND_EXIT_CODE, the exit code of the privous shell command
  - COMMAND_DURATION, the duration of the shell command
  - SBP_TMP, a tmp folder which is local to your shell PID and cleaned upon exit
  - SBP_CACHE, a cache folder which is global to all SBP processes
  - SBP_PATH, the path to the SBP diectory
  - SEGMENTS_MAX_LENGTH tells your segment how much space it should use. This is
  not a hard limit, but a suggestion for when to start trimming/compacting the
  segment.
```

When you have defined the parts you want to use in your segment you need to
theme the parts by issuing the following command:
```
  print_themed_segment 'normal/higlight' "${segment_pars[@]}"
```

## Configuration
All segments should adhere to the SEGMENTS_MAX_LENGTH variable, but you can set
SEGMENTS_${SEGMENT}_MAX_LENGTH to a specific value or -1 to disable
truncation/compacting for that specific segment.
